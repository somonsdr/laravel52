	<h1>INSTALL GIT</h1>
	<p>GitHub   provides   desktop   clients   that   include   a   graphical   user 
	interface  for  the  most  common  repository  actions  and  an  automatically updating command line edition of Git for advanced  scenarios.</p>
	<h2>Public Access</h2>
	<p>What if you want anonymous read access to your project? Perhaps instead of hosting an internal private project, you want to host an open source project.</p>
	<h2>Probably the simplest</h2>
	<p>Probably the simplest way for smaller setups is to run a static web server with its document root where your Git repositories are, and then enable that post update hook we mentioned in the first section of this chapter.</p>
	<h3>Git Basics - Viewing the Commit History</h3>
	<p><strong>Viewing the Commit History</strong> <br>After you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with an existing commit history, youâ€™ll probably want to look back to see what has happened. The most basic and powerful tool to do this is the git log command.</p>
